## How to install
1. Run Minecraft with [Chisel Decor](https://github.com/KnowYourKnot/ChiselDecor/releases) installed to generate the necessary config folders and files.
2. Download the ZIP file for the desired blockpack and extract.
3. Remove the blockpack folder from within the ZIP file or skip to step 4 if the textures lang and types folders are visible.
4. Place the blockpack's folder in the `config/chiseldecor` directory.
5. Edit the `config/chiseldecor/config.json` file. The entry `block_packs` should be a comma separated list of the names of the  blockpacks you want to load. A list should look like "cool, red".
6. Open Minecraft. Your blockpack(s) should have been loaded!
